# -TracingNTMBehavior_Czaplewski
This is the repository for Jason Czaplewski's second theory of computing project
Note that for the Readme the PDF is there it just needs to be downloaded since that is the only way to upload that type of document. The other images
and code should be able to be accessed fine when they are clicked on. The Readme is also submitted on canvas. The Readme is in the evaluation spot and
the teamwork document is in the project 2 submisssion spot.
